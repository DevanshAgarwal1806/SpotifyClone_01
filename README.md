This is a frontend project built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is basically a small Clone of Spotify where you can access different playlist and listen to songs.
The project is responsive, which can be accessed properly on any device.
It is hosted on Netlify, So, you can open it using this website(https://clinquant-liger-6759cc.netlify.app/).
It works in such a way that when you click on different playlists, different songs are loaded into the library on the left which can be played accordingly. We can also change the song, seek and change the volume.
